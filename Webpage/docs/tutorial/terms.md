## Terms preliminaries

Before we describe Hamiltonians, which are available, let's briefly describe terms, which are currently implemented in SOLIDstate.

The current version of the SOLIDstate has support only for  terms that can be described up to second rank tensor (matrix), which corresponds up to two-body terms.

## Hop

### Fermions (spinless)

\\[
\sum_{ij}  \left(t_{ij} a^\dagger_i a_j + \mathrm{H.c.}\right)
\\]

**Standard label**: `t`

### Spins \\(\tfrac12\\)

## Create Pair

### Fermions (spinless)

## Create One
