## Terms preliminaries

Before we describe Hamiltonians, which are avaliable, let's briefly describe terms, which are current implemented in SOLIDstate.

Current version of the SOLIDstate has support only for  terms which can be described up to second rank tensor (matrix), which corresponds up to two-body terms.

## Hop

### Fermions (spinless)

\\[
\sum_{ij}  \left(t_{ij} a^\dagger_i a_j + \mathrm{H.c.}\right)
\\]

**Standard label**: `t`

### Spins \\(\tfrac12\\)

## Create Pair

### Fermions (spinless)

## Create One
