SOLIDstate has variety of pre-defined Hamiltonians, which are avaliable for users.
To select Hamiltonian of the `QuantumSystem` one just has to use the following method

```c++
qSystem.SelectHamiltonian<KitaevHamiltonian>();
```

In this example we have shown how to select `KitaevHamiltonian`.


## Kitaev Hamiltonian

\\[
\hat H =     
\\]

## tV Hamiltonian

## Ising Hamiltonian

## Ising in the transverse field Hamiltonian
